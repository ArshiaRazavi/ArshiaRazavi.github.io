In this short experiment, I compared the matrix multiplication performance of my **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU** with my **AMD Ryzen 9 7900X CPU**. The results were surprising — check it out!

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in deep learning and scientific computing. It plays a central role in training neural networks, which is why GPUs have become essential tools in machine learning and AI research.

## Method

I measured the time taken to multiply two large square matrices of size **N×N** on both CPU and GPU using MATLAB.

- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti  
- **Tool**: MATLAB with built-in CPU and GPU matrix support

## Results

The GPU significantly outperformed the CPU, and the performance gap grew as matrix size increased. For example:

- At size **1000×1000**, the GPU was ~**10× faster**  
- At size **10000×10000**, the GPU was ~**65× faster**

This dramatic speedup is due to the GPU’s ability to perform highly parallel computations.

## Conclusion

For large-scale matrix operations, especially in deep learning or numerical simulations, GPU acceleration offers **orders of magnitude improvement** over traditional CPUs. It's not just a luxury — it’s a necessity for efficient computation.
